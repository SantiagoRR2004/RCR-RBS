# Rule-Based System for choosing a degree

## Overview

This is a project for a subject called "Representaci√≥n del Conocimiento y Razonamiento" (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) that accounted for 10% of the final grade. It was made by a team of 2 people. The submission took place on Tuesday, the 14th of May of 2024, and earned a grade of 10 out of 10 points.

## Project Summary

For this project we had to create a recommender system in Prolog for a topic of our choosing. We decided on choosing what degree to study based on the student's interests and skills. The system asks the user a series of questions and based on the answers it gives a recommendation of what degree to study. It was rewarded to have up to 15 parameters and have some of them be multi-valued.
